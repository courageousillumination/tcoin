I think I'd like TCoin to be a testing/development/learning coin primairly. Choices should be made to enforce these ideas over actual usability (but don't comprimise security unless it's in a controlled scenario).

So I want to build this up incrementally:

- A centralized ledger, arbitrary content
- A decentralized, PoW ledger, with arbitrary content
- A decentralized, PoW ledger, with transactions

I would also think about all of the bits and pieces (i.e. networking, hashing, etc.) that
need to be accounted for at each step.
